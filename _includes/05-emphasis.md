### You will **Not** Believe **This** Happened! 😲

is a regular clickbait, but I will tell you an interesting story. So when I was walking through the road last summer, I saw a *large flower* 💮in the middle of the road, it smelled really good, and wilh its bright pink flower, everyone rushed to take photos of it. The bright pink flower swayed and moved as if doing a little dance for its admirers. Endless astonished people started doing instagram lives and news reporters started gushing in. Seeing the amount of people, the flower was overwhelmed and angry and started eating the people over there one by one, like a giant venus flytrap, made for humans. Now I run from there to save my life. 

This **happened**! In my dream obviously 😛. Aren't we all running in our dreams anyway 🏃 Bold of you to assume a lot of people gathering in last summer even in lockdown 🕵️‍♀️
